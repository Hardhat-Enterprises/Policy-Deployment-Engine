# GCP Backup and DR: Location Policy

This policy ensures that all `google_backup_dr_backup_vault` resources are created in **approved GCP locations**, specifically within Australia.

## üìå Policy Objective

The objective of this policy is to enforce the use of allowed GCP regions for backup vaults‚Äîprimarily for **compliance, data residency**, and **latency optimization**. Only Australian regions are allowed.

## ‚úÖ Compliant Example

```hcl
resource "google_backup_dr_backup_vault" "c" {
  provider = google-beta
  backup_vault_id = "backup-vault-c"
  location = "australia-southeast1"
  backup_minimum_enforced_retention_duration = "86400s"
}
```

```hcl
resource "google_backup_dr_backup_vault" "nc" {
  provider = google-beta
  backup_vault_id = "backup-vault-nc"
  location = "australia-southeast1"
  backup_minimum_enforced_retention_duration = "3600s"
}
```

## üß™ How It Works

The policy checks the `location` attribute for all `google_backup_dr_backup_vault` resources. Allowed values:
- `australia-southeast1`
- `AU`

Any vault configured outside these regions will be marked as **non-compliant**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Policy

```bash
opa eval \
  --data ./policies/gcp \
  --input ./inputs/gcp/backupdr/vault/location/plan.json \
  --format pretty \
  "data.terraform.gcp.security.backupdr.vault.location.summary.message"
```
## ‚úÖ Sample Output

If both vaults use compliant regions, the OPA evaluation output will be:

```text
[
  "Total GCP Backup Vaults found: 2",
  "Non-compliant GCP Backup Vaults: 0/2"
]
```
